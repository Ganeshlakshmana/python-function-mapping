# Python Function Mapping 

A comprehensive Python project developed for the DLMDSPWP01 module at IU. This solution selects ideal functions for a given training dataset based on least-square error, maps test data under a √2 deviation constraint, stores results in a SQLite database, and visualizes the relationships using Bokeh.

## Summary of Modifications and Features

-  Used **official datasets** provided via tutor ticket (not dummy)
-  Applied **least-square deviation** to select 4 ideal functions from 50
-  Mapped test data points with √2 * max deviation rule
-  Built using **modular OOP** (class-based design)
-  Stored results in **SQLite** using **SQLAlchemy ORM**
-  Created **interactive Bokeh visualizations**
-  Fully **unit tested with pytest**
-  Anti-plagiarism compliant with academic declaration
-  Deployment-ready structure with `requirements.txt` and Git integration

## How to Run This Project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ganeshlakshmana/python-function-mapping.git
cd python-function-mapping

# Setup Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

---

## Run Unit Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

- Validates correct ideal function selection and test data mapping logic
- Includes mock test data generation

---

## Outputs & Verification

- `outputs/visualization.html` → View in browser for interactive plots
- `data/ideal_functions.db` → Open with DB Browser for SQLite to inspect mapped results
- `tests/test_all.py` → Unit tests with `pytest`

## Academic Integrity Note

This project was built and submitted independently as part of coursework for **IU – DLMDSPWP01: Programming with Python**. The solution follows IU's academic integrity guidelines and Turnitin compliance requirements.
